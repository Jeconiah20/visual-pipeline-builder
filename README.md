# visual-pipeline-builder
 A visual pipeline builder built with React, ReactFlow, and FastAPI. Users can create pipelines by dragging and connecting nodes. A reusable BaseNode abstraction reduces duplication, and the backend validates the pipeline by counting nodes, edges, and checking if it forms a DAG.
